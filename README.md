# PS05

The following directory contains files for Problem Set 05 for EC320: Introduction to Econometerics Spring 2024 at the University of Oregon. You can find the main repository for the course [here](https://www.github.com/ajdickinson/EC320S24)


## Instructions

First, download the repository by downloading the zip file from the green "Code" button. Unzip/extract the zip file. It is a good idea to do this in a directory dedicated to this class. An example of a file path to save this zip file in would be: `~/Documents/classes/EC320S24/problem_sets/`). Once unzipped, open the `EC320S24_PS05.Rproj` which will open RStudio.

Navigate to the `Files` tab in the bottom right panel of RStudio. You should see the following files:

```
.
├── EC320S24_PS05.Rproj
├── R
│   └── PS05.Rmd
└── README.md

2 directories, 3 files
```

The assignment can be found in the `PS04.Rmd` file. 

### Data

The data from this problem set are a sample of district level data from the state of Massachusetts in 1998. It can be loaded into memory through installing the `AER` package from CRAN (i.e., `install.packages("AER")`). By default, the Rmd will do this for you. After downloading, simply knit the document (cmd/ctrl + shift + k) and make sure everything looks okay.

The Massachusetts data are district-wide averages for public elementary school districts in 1998. The data analyzed here are the overall total score, which is the sum of the scores on the English, Math, and Science portions of the test. Data on the student-teacher ratio, the percent of students receiving a subsidized lunch and on the percent of students still learning english are averages for each elementary school district for the 1997–1998 school year and were obtained from the Massachusetts department of education. Data on average district income are from the 1990 US Census.

### Integrity

If you are suspected of cheating, you will receive a zero—for the assignment and possibly for the course. Cheating includes copying work from your classmates, from the internet, and from previous problem sets. You are encouraged to work with your peers, but everyone must submit their own solutions.
